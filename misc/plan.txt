Chess is a game where 2 players play on a 64 square board. Both players will have 16 pieces
each.

8 pawns
2 knights
2 bishops
2 rooks
1 queen
1 king

The idea of the game is for 1 player to trap the other players king (Checkmate) where the king
no longer has any legal moves.

Players will take turns moving pieces to different squares on the board depending on that pieces
scope.

- Pawns can move 2 squares forward on their first move
	* After first move they can only move 1 square forward / can't move backwards
	* Can capture pieces 1 square diagonal to them
	* 1 special pawn move is called En Pessant where if a pawn's first move is 2 squares
		forward and lands next to a pawn that belongs to the opposing player, than the opposing
		pawn can capture it by moving to the square behind that 2 squared pawn

- Knights can move 1 square over and 2 squares up or down.
	* the only piece that can jump over other pieces.

- Bishops can move to all sqaures diagonal to it that aren't occupied by another piece.

- Rooks can move to all sqaures up/down/left/right that aren't occupied by another piece.

- Queen can move in all directions to any square that isn't occupied by another piece.

- King can move in all directions to only 1 square that isn't occupied by another piece.
	* can't move to a sqaure that will put it in check

Pieces are also worth points that should be tracked to show which player has an advantage.

- Pawns    1
- Knight   3
- Bishop   3
- Rook     5
- Queen    9
- King     - 

When a piece moves to a square that gives it a direct path to the opposing players king
it is called check. In this state the opposing player must move the king to escape check.
If the king as no legal squares to move to escape check than it is Checkmate (Game Over).

A few things to consider are tactics in chess:

- Pin
	* When a piece cannot move because doing so would put that player's king in check.

- Fork
	* When a piece is able to attack multiple pieces simultaneously.
	* This is often used when putting the king in check becuase the king will be forced to move
	  allowing a capture of another piece.

- Discovered Attack
	* When a piece moves allowing a piece behind it to put the opposing king in check.

- Skewer
	* When a piece puts the king in check allowing for that piece to attack an opposing piece
		behind the king once it moves.


Board setup will be something like this:

  board.squares["A1"].value = Rook.new(:grid => grid, 
                                       :square =>board.squares["A1"],
                                       :player => player1)
  board.squares["A2"].value = Pawn.new(:grid => grid, 
                                       :square => board.squares["A2"],
                                       :player => player1)
  board.squares["B1"].value = Knight.new(:grid => grid, 
                                         :square => board.squares["B1"],
                                         :player => player1)
  board.squares["B2"].value = Pawn.new(:grid => grid, 
                                       :square => board.squares["B2"],
                                       :player => player1)





  board
    @players
    @player1, @player2 = @players
    @white_pieces = assign_pieces(@player1)
    @black_pieces = assign_pieces(@player2)
